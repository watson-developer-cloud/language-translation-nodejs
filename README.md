  The IBM Watson&trade; [Language Translator][service_url] service provides an Application Programming Interface (API) that lets you identify the language of text, and then use a custom business domain to translate the text from one supported language to another.  
  You can translate either by letting the service identify the source language or by selecting a source language and then by selecting a target language, and a business domain. Domain translation is linguistically targeted these business domains:
  * *The News domain* - targeted at news articles and transcripts, it translates English to and from Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese, French, Italian, or Spanish. It also translates Spanish to and from French.
  * *The Conversational domain* - targeted at conversational colloquialisms, it translates English to and from Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese, French, Italian, or Spanish.
  * *The Patent domain* - targeted at technical and legal terminology, it translates Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese, or Spanish to English.

## Prerequisites

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/watson-developer-cloud/language-translator-nodejs.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

1. Sign up for an [IBM Cloud account](https://console.bluemix.net/registration/).
1. Download the [IBM Cloud CLI](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cli/index.html#overview).
1. Create an instance of the Language Translator service and get your credentials:
    - Go to the [Language Translator](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/language-translator) page in the IBM Cloud Catalog.
    - Log in to your IBM Cloud account.
    - Click **Create**.
    - Click **Show** to view the service credentials.
    - Copy the `apikey` value, or copy the `username` and `password` values if your service instance doesn't provide an `apikey`.
    - Copy the `url` value.

## Configuring the application

1. In the application folder, copy the *.env.example* file and create a file called *.env*

    ```
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2. Open the *.env* file and add the service credentials that you obtained in the previous step.

    Example *.env* file that configures the `apikey` and `url` for a Language Translator service instance hosted in the US East region:

    ```
    LANGUAGE_TRANSLATOR_IAM_APIKEY=X4rbi8vwZmKpXfowaS3GAsA7vdy17Qh7km5D6EzKLHL2
    LANGUAGE_TRANSLATOR_URL=https://gateway-wdc.watsonplatform.net/language-translator/api
    ```

    - If your service instance uses `username` and `password` credentials, add the `LANGUAGE_TRANSLATOR_USERNAME` and `LANGUAGE_TRANSLATOR_PASSWORD` variables to the *.env* file.

    Example *.env* file that configures the `username`, `password`, and `url` for a Language Translator service instance hosted in the Sydney region:

    ```
    LANGUAGE_TRANSLATOR_USERNAME=522be-7b41-ab44-dec3-g1eab2ha73c6
    LANGUAGE_TRANSLATOR_PASSWORD=A4Z5BdGENrwu8
    LANGUAGE_TRANSLATOR_URL=https://gateway-syd.watsonplatform.net/language-translator/api
    ```
